/**
 * Ray-Casting algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon
 * 
 * Example case
 *
 * Let's  say we have a point and a polygon already, represented by this graph:
 *
 *   |
 *  5|
 *   |
 *   |
 *  4|                       * Vertice B (4, 4)
 *   |                      / \
 *   |                     /   \
 *  3|     * Point (1, 3) /     \
 *   |                   /       \
 *   |                  /         \
 *  2|                 /           \
 *   |                /             \
*    |               /               \
 *  1|             * Vertice A (2, 1) \
 *   |              \                  \
 *   |               \                  \
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 *  0|     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
 *
 *
 * We will draw a horizontal line from Point and for each line between the vertices, 
 * we will figure out whether our horizontal line crosses that line. 
 * Then if the total number is even (or zero) after doing that calculation for all lines, 
 * we know the point is outside, if it is odd it's inside:
 *
 *  *
 *   |
 *  5|        * -----------------------------------------> 0 collisions, point is outside
 *   |
 *   |
 *  4|                       * Vertice B (4, 4)
 *   |                      / \
 *   |                     /   \
 *  3|     * -----------> /---->\----------> 2 collisions, even, point is outside
 *   |                   /       \
 *   |                  /         \
 *  2|                 /           \
 *   |                /    *------->\------> 1 collision, odd, point is inside
*    |               /               \
 *  1|             * Vertice A (2, 1) \
 *   |              \                  \
 *   |               \                  \
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 *  0|     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
 *
 *
 * So if we don't have the lines, only the corners of the polygon how do we 
 * calculate the intersections?
 *
 * y = mx + b
 * In this standard linear equation, M is the slope of the line and B is the 
 * y-intercept of the line. So if we rearrange it to solve for an X value 
 * (as we want to find the X value at which our horizontal line from our point 
 * would touch the edge, and whether that value is > the real X), 
 * we can insert our point Y value as Y and get our result if we have M and B 
 * for the line between two vertices.
 *
 * In our example:
 *  *
 *   |
 *  5|
 *   |
 *   |
 *  4|                       * Vertice B (4, 4)
 *   |                      / \
 *   |                     /   \
 *  3|     * Point (1, 3) /     \
 *   |                   /       \
 *   |                  /         \
 *  2|                 /           \
 *   |                /             \
*    |               /               \
 *  1|             * Vertice A (2, 1) \
 *   |              \                  \
 *   |               \                  \
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 *  0|     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
 *
 * M is 1.5:
 * m = (aY - bY) / (aX - bX)
 * m = ( 1 - 4 ) / ( 2 - 4 )
 * m = 1,5
 * 
 * B is -2:
 * b = ((aX * -1) * m) + aY
 * b = (( 2 * -1) * 1.5) + 1
 * b = -2
 * 
 * Therefore our intercept point is 3.33:
 * x = (pY - b) / m
 * x = (3 - -2) / 1.5
 * x = 3,33
 *
 * 3.33 is > our point's X val of 1, so this time the ray intercepts the line. 
 * We would do this calculation for all the other edges, 
 * and in our example we would have 2 intercepts, so Point is outside the polygon.
